Some mornings I wake up and don’t recognize myself right away.  
The mirror offers a version I half remember—someone shaped by years I thought I was still living. It’s strange how the body keeps changing even when the mind insists it’s the same. The hands remember things the heart has already let go of. The eyes know how to look forward but still search for the past.

Time doesn’t move the way we imagine it does. It doesn’t flow like water or fall like sand. It folds. It bends. It gathers pieces of us and scatters them elsewhere. I think about who I was at twenty, at fifteen, at ten, and how all those selves still live somewhere in the architecture of my thoughts. None of them are gone; they’ve just learned how to whisper from other rooms.

There are days when I feel like a collection of echoes—some soft, some sharp. I wonder if identity is less a single voice and more a chorus trying to stay in tune. The child who believed in endless summers, the student who thought knowledge meant certainty, the adult who now knows that understanding is mostly learning to let go—they all still exist, layered inside the same skin.

People talk about finding themselves as if it were a destination, a place with a door you can open and step into. But what if we never really arrive? What if selfhood is just motion—the continuous rearranging of what time refuses to hold still? Every version of me has been certain it was the final one. None of them were right.

Sometimes I look at old photographs and feel like I’m trespassing. The smile, the posture, the world behind those eyes—they all belonged to someone who didn’t know I’d be standing here one day, staring back. There’s something both comforting and terrifying about that. The distance between who we were and who we’ve become is made entirely of things we can’t return to.

Maybe that’s why we write. To bridge those distances. To speak across years to versions of ourselves that no longer answer. Every sentence feels like a message in a bottle thrown into the sea of memory, hoping that one of the older selves might still be floating somewhere, listening.

I used to think change meant loss. Now I think it means survival. The ability to keep moving, to keep becoming, to keep rewriting the same story in a new tense. We are not who we were yesterday, and yet, without who we were, we couldn’t exist today. That paradox is what makes being human both unbearable and miraculous.

At night, when the house is quiet, I sometimes whisper my own name aloud—not to remind myself who I am, but to hear how it sounds now. It carries a weight it didn’t use to. It sounds older, slower, a little more fragile, but still mine. Maybe identity isn’t about holding on. Maybe it’s about learning to greet yourself again each morning and saying, gently, “I remember you, but I know you’ve changed.”
