There are days when memory feels like light through broken glass—scattered, bright in some places, dark in others. I keep finding pieces of you in strange corners of my mind. A song in a café. A scent that doesn’t belong to anyone anymore. A phrase I still hear the way you used to say it. Sometimes I think memory doesn’t fade; it only changes shape, like water finding new paths to flow through.

We used to believe that time would make things clearer. It doesn’t. It only rearranges the distance. I still see your face sometimes, not the exact one you left with, but one made of memory’s edits—sharper in kindness, blurred in anger. The mind is a kind liar. It keeps what hurts just enough to remind you that you once had something worth missing.

I wonder what you remember of me. Do you still picture me standing by the door that last morning, unsure if leaving was the right thing? Or have I become only a detail—a familiar voice without a name? It’s strange, the way people vanish not all at once, but gradually, like fading photographs that forget which color came first.

I’ve stopped trying to hold onto things exactly as they were. Objects betray us. Letters lose their scent. Voices warp in recordings. Even the words we once shared sound foreign now when I speak them aloud. But sometimes, when the world grows quiet, I hear laughter that doesn’t belong to the present, and for a second, I am there again—in that moment that refuses to die.

Maybe that’s what grief really is: the persistence of a story that no longer has a listener. You tell it anyway, not to remember, but to keep the silence from swallowing it whole. Every time I think I’ve finished telling it, another version appears, gentler, smaller, easier to carry. You would have liked that—I think. The slow transformation of pain into something almost beautiful.

I no longer look for you in crowds. I’ve stopped expecting the past to return as a person. But every now and then, when the light hits a window just right or a song ends in the same key we once danced to, I feel the air shift, as if memory were reaching out again, not to take me back, but to remind me that I once belonged somewhere.

What remains of us is not what we built or broke, but the space between both—the unfinished sentences, the almost-answered calls, the half-closed doors. The quiet between what was said and what was meant. I think that’s where love continues to live: not in presence, but in echo.

Tonight, I’ll sleep knowing that forgetting isn’t the opposite of remembering. It’s just another way of carrying. Some things stay, not because they refuse to leave, but because they’ve learned how to stay softly, without noise, without weight. Maybe you’re one of them.
