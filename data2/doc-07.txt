The office was almost silent by the time I looked up from my screen.  
Outside the windows, the city was turning gold, the last light of the day stretching across towers of glass and steel. Inside, the hum of the air conditioner was the only sound left. Most of the desks were empty now. The monitors glowed faintly, screensavers drifting like slow waves through a sea of forgotten work.

I leaned back in my chair and rubbed my eyes. The reflection in the dark window looked strange—a figure surrounded by rectangles of light, motionless except for the faint rise and fall of breathing. For a moment, I didn’t recognize it as me. It looked like someone waiting for permission to move.

Down the hall, the elevator chimed. Footsteps echoed, then faded. Somewhere, a printer came to life and spat out a single page before falling quiet again. I wondered who had sent it. Maybe no one. Maybe the machine simply refused to accept that the day was over.

I stood and walked to the window. From this floor, the city looked like circuitry—streets glowing, cars pulsing through intersections, lights blinking in perfect rhythm. It was beautiful in a mechanical way, a pattern too complex to understand but easy to admire. I pressed my hand against the glass and felt the faint vibration of the world outside. It felt alive, but distant.

On the desk beside mine, someone had left a half-empty cup of coffee. The surface had gone cold, thin lines forming on the top like tiny cracks in a frozen lake. There was something sad about it, this evidence of life left behind by people rushing toward other lives. I thought about how much of our existence is made up of things unfinished—messages unsent, thoughts interrupted, cups gone cold.

The lights dimmed automatically at six-thirty. The walls shifted from white to amber, softer, almost kind. I sat back down and opened my notebook. It wasn’t work I wanted to write about, but something smaller—the moment between leaving and staying. I wrote about the sound of keys clicking in an empty room, about the faint buzz of electricity in the walls, about how time feels thicker when no one is watching.

Through the window, the skyline flickered to life. One by one, the buildings lit up, and for a second, I imagined that the city was breathing again after holding its breath all day. The thought comforted me in a strange way. Maybe all of us were just lights waiting for the dark to remind us we existed.

I stayed until the janitor came by, his cart rattling softly down the hall. He nodded as he passed, a silent agreement that we were both witnesses to the same hour when the city shifts from noise to glow. When I finally packed my things, the floor felt too quiet, too large. My footsteps echoed back at me as if the room didn’t want me to leave.

In the elevator, my reflection stared at me from the mirrored walls—tired, small, but still somehow present. When the doors opened at the lobby, a rush of warm air met me, carrying the sound of traffic and voices. I stepped outside and looked up. The buildings were brighter now, their lights pulsing against the deep blue sky.

For a moment, I stood there, caught between the stillness of the office and the rhythm of the street. The city moved like a tide, carrying everyone somewhere. I slipped into it, one more current among thousands, thinking about the way days end without really ending, how we leave pieces of ourselves glowing quietly behind.
