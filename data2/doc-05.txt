The city woke before the sun.  
The air carried the hum of engines, the low rhythm of footsteps, and the metallic sigh of shutters opening for the day. Neon signs still burned against the gray light, flickering like tired eyes. I stepped into the street with coffee in one hand and the feeling that everything was already moving faster than I was prepared for.

The pavement was slick from last night’s rain. It reflected the world upside down—cars, traffic lights, faces, fragments of motion. A bus passed, trailing wind and the smell of diesel. A woman in a red coat crossed in front of me, her reflection cutting through puddles. Somewhere, a phone rang, unanswered. The city spoke in fragments, and everyone seemed fluent in its interruptions.

I walked without direction, following the current of people. The shops were opening, the first taxis honked, and the air buzzed with invisible signals—notifications, alerts, vibrations in pockets. I thought about how the city never really sleeps; it only switches screens. Even silence here has electricity in it.

At a corner café, I stopped for another coffee. The glass windows vibrated faintly each time a train passed beneath the street. Inside, people scrolled, typed, spoke in half-heard sentences. It was strange how full of voices a place could be and still feel empty. I wondered when conversation had become background noise.

Outside again, the light grew harsher. The morning filled with motion—bikes weaving through traffic, delivery vans stopping without warning, a thousand small negotiations for space and time. I crossed toward the river where the skyline mirrored itself on the surface. The water looked like glass, flawless until a breeze shattered it. Even beauty here came with static.

I sat on a bench overlooking the bridge. The constant flow of cars above and boats below made the city feel alive in a mechanical way. It reminded me of breathing—repetitive, essential, unnoticed until you stop to listen. I pulled out my notebook, but the words came differently than before. Short. Broken. Like headlines instead of thoughts. The city didn’t allow long sentences.

For a moment, I closed my eyes. Beneath the noise, I could hear other things—the soft rhythm of shoes against concrete, a child’s laugh, the low hum of power lines. The chaos wasn’t without pattern; it only hid it well. Maybe peace wasn’t gone, only translated into another language.

When I opened my eyes again, the morning had turned to day. The crowd had thickened, and I was one more figure moving among them. The air smelled of exhaust and coffee and something burning from a food cart. Screens glowed in every direction, reflecting the same headlines, the same weather, the same warnings. I finished my drink and started walking again.

The city moved around me like an endless conversation that no one was really having. Words spilled, lights flashed, doors opened and closed, and somewhere between it all, I felt both lost and strangely connected. Maybe that’s what cities do—they remind you that belonging and loneliness can exist on the same street.

By the time I reached my apartment, the sun had risen fully, flooding the buildings with sharp light. The windows across the street reflected it back like mirrors, hundreds of tiny suns. I stood for a moment before going inside, thinking about how the city never stops reflecting itself—how we are all mirrors too, carrying fragments of noise and light, trying to make sense of the echo.
